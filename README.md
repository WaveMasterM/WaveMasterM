## 🎯 My Dev Journey (So Far...)

      ```yaml
    2025:
      - [x] Joined College
      - [x] Started Python
      - [x] Created my GitHub profile 🌊
      - [✔️] Built my first Python mini-project
      - [ ] Started contributing to open source
      - [x] Won a coding competition 🏆


## 🐚 Fun Facts About Me
- 🏄‍♂️  Coding might be a challenge now, but trust me—every wave I ride gets me closer to mastery.
- 🌊 I treat bugs in code like enemies in Free Fire — no mercy, all headshots.
- ⚽ I once tried to build a Python calculator while watching a cricket match... let’s just say neither worked out 😅
- 🎮 My hands have more muscle memory for gaming than typing, but I’m fixing that 😤
- 💡 My brain thinks in if-else conditions now. Should I eat? if hungry: eat() else: nap()
- 🧠 I once tried to teach my pet to code… turns out, it prefers HTML over Python 🐕‍🦺
- 👟 Can sprint 100m faster than my Wi-Fi can load Stack Overflow (pain.)
- 🐢 I type slow now, but one day I’ll be speed-typing like those montage coders in movies
- 🧊 I'm cooler than an ice cube in Antarctica... but only when my code runs without errors 😎
